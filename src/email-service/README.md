# Email Service

This is an API for the email service built to complete the final project of the Microservice Architecture course.

Prerequisites:

- Node.js (tested with v19.9.0)
- MongoDB (tested with v1.9.1)

Notes:

- Pact files are ignored in the .gitignore file.
- In our development environment on Windows, we encountered an issue where we couldn't install the Pact package when running npm install. However, it works fine on Linux.

Please make sure you have the required prerequisites installed and set up the .env file before running the application.
